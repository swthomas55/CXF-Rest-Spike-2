Another attempt at a CXF/Spring based Rest service, starting from
https://cwiki.apache.org/CXF20DOC/jax-rs-maven-plugins.html

Wrap the return bean in a Resource with Links.

Added index.html so I can play with the primitive HATEOAS nature thus revealed.

New questions:

The Link URLs replicate path information from
* The servlet context
* The class Path
This is not good (not DRY at least). What power tools are available (via Spring) to get the correct path prefixes at run time?

For building a reflective web interface on these HATEOAS messages, what is a good tool? (Backbone, maybe)


Actions revealed here:

get /
click on "Get a bean" button. The val1 and val2 values are displayed. Each time you get a new bean, the values increment.
Note that the bean value list has 2 links:
"echo" just runs the echo service, but
"copy" posts the bean values back to the server, copying the first value to the second
